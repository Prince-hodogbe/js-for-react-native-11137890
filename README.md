# js-for-react-native-11137890
### Task 1

* Created a JavaScript file `arrayManipulation.js`
* Wrote a function `processArray` that takes an array of numbers, squares each even number, and triples each odd number

### Task 2

* Added a function `formatArrayStrings` to `arrayManipulation.js`
* The function takes two arrays as arguments: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by `processArray`
* Modifies each string based on its corresponding number: capitalizes entire string if number is even, converts to lowercase if number is odd

### Task 3

* Created a file `userInfo.js`
* Wrote a function `createUserProfiles` that takes an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2
* Returns an array of objects, each containing `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and `id` (auto-incremented starting from 1)

### Task 4

* Created a README file with student ID and brief explanation of each task

## Submission

* Committed each task separately to GitHub repository `js-for-react-native-<11137890>`
* Ignored `node_modules` before pushing
* Submitted a compressed folder of the repository
